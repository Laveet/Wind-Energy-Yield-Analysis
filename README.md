# Wind Energy Yield Estimation Tool

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This tool is designed to estimate the **total annual energy yield** of a wind turbine using user-provided wind speed time series data and turbine specifications. It also generates useful visualizations and monthly statistics to help analyze wind resource potential at a given location.

## ðŸ“‚ What You Need to Provide

Please make sure to follow the **format guidelines provided in this repository** when preparing the input files.

### 1. Wind Speed Time Series
- Upload the wind speed data in the required format (sample format is given in this repository).

### 2. Measurement Details
- **Measurement Height** (height at which wind speeds were recorded) in meters.
- **Surface Roughness Length** (in meters).
- **Hub Height** of the wind turbine (in meters).

### 3. Wind Turbine Power Curve
- Upload the wind turbine's power curve file (format given in this repositry).

After uploading the required data, the tool will generate:

- âœ… **Total Annual Energy Yield** (in MWh)
- âœ… **Monthly Energy Production Table**
- âœ… **Wind Speed Time Series Visualization**
- âœ… **Average Daily Wind Speed Plot**
- âœ… **Power Duration Curve**
